# churn_project.py
A Python project for churn prediction using machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN). It guides users step-by-step, from dataset visualization to data preprocessing (standardization, balancing), helping businesses identify the best-performing model for their goals.

For academic reasons and with the intention of making the project useful in business contexts as well, we developed flexible code that can be adapted to different realities. The main focus is to provide tools to understand the dataset, process the data in a robust way, and compare the performance of different models according to business objectives.


## ðŸš€ About us
We are students who are passionate about data science and machine learning. This project is a practical application of the skills we acquired during the Data Mining and Text Analytics course. Our mission is to offer flexible and reproducible tools for data analysis, with a vision geared toward both learning and practical applications in the corporate world.
