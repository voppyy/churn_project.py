# Churn Prediction with Machine Learning Models
This project, created for the university course in Data Mining and Text Analytics, aims to predict customer churn through a step-by-step approach, allowing anyone to use and analyze a dataset even without knowing it in detail.

For academic reasons and with the intention of making the project useful in business contexts as well, we developed flexible code that can be adapted to different realities. The main focus is to provide tools to understand the dataset, process the data in a robust way, and compare the performance of different models according to business objectives.


## ðŸš€ About us
We are students who are passionate about data science and machine learning. This project is a practical application of the skills we acquired during the Data Mining and Text Analytics course. Our mission is to offer flexible and reproducible tools for data analysis, with a vision geared toward both learning and practical applications in the corporate world.
